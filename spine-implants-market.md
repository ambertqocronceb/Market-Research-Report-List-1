<p><strong>The Spine Implants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Spine Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine implants market encompasses two main applications: open spine surgery and minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS). Open spine surgery involves traditional large incisions to treat spinal conditions, allowing for direct access and visualization. Conversely, MISS uses smaller incisions, leading to reduced tissue damage, shorter recovery times, and less postoperative pain. Both approaches utilize advanced spine implants to stabilize the spine, alleviate pain, and enhance patient outcomes, reflecting the evolving landscape of spinal healthcare.</p></p>
